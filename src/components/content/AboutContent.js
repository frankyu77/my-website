                <p>IMAGE OF ME</p>
                <p>Originally from Calgary, Alberta, I am currently studying at the University of British Columbia, majoring in Computer Science 
                    with a minor in Commerce. This combination allows me to continuously challenge my problem-solving and critical thinking skills 
                    while applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios! I chose Commerce as my minor because I am eager to understand how organizations 
                    operate, from bigger companies to startup businesses, and to educate myself about the market and economy.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am interested in machine learning and their applications....</p>
